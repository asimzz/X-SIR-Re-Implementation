{"prompt": "Why do old games running on new hardware still have technical issues?\nAn elaboration of the question: I am playing some mega man games on my Xbox One and experience slowdown when there are a lot of enemies on screen. but the Xbox One is significantly more powerful than the NES, so why is there still slowdown on this hardware?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["The XBox is emulating NES hardware and running the emulation at a set speed. If it ran it at as fast as possible, then it would be several times faster than the original NES game and would be unplayable. I can't speak for Mega Man exactly, but older games tended to run on a cycle locked to the screen refresh which was a fixed 60Hz or 50Hz. There was only one piece of hardware they ran on, so there was no need to adjust for different hardware speeds.", "In that case, it's probably on purpose - they want to emulate the experience as closely as possible, even including the slowdown and sprite flickering. Some emulators let you turn it off, but it's usually turned on by default. In other cases, like if you're trying to emulate PS2 games on your PC, the game might just run really slow in general. Even though your PC is way more powerful than a PS2, it has to \"translate\" from PS2 language to PC language in realtime, which is much more difficult than running PS2 code on the PS2 itself."]}
{"prompt": "Why are electrical lines slack between poles?\nAn elaboration of the question: Is there a good reason or is it just that they're too heavy to be pulled taut?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Because if they were pulled taut, then a strong wind could bend the poles away from each other and snap the lines, loosing high energy power lines onto the ground below which can be extremely dangerous. A little bit of slack is just fine.", "There are a few reasons. First, they're metal. Metals expand and contract with heat--if there was no slack, they'd possibly break under extreme temperature changes. Second, birds and debris sometimes land on them. You need them to be able to take some weight, which means they can't be stretched too tight.", "The lines have mass. So there is something that needs to hold them up. Any force is composed of a horizontal and a vertical force. And a line under tension have a force following the line. So in order to keep the line up you need a certain force up on each pole in addition to the horizontal force. You could increase the horizontal force which would make the line more straight but it would still have some slack in them. You can not get rid of it. The amount of slack in a power line is a compromise between the force that can be applied to the lines before they or the poles snap in wind and how tight the lines have to be to not hit each other or the ground."]}
{"prompt": "Why is it so hard to completely prevent clipping of 3D models in video games?\nAn elaboration of the question: To be clear, I know nothing about programming or 3D graphics. Naively, I would think you could just give objects some property by which they cannot pass through each other. Yet I see some degree of clipping in almost every big studio 3D game. Why is this so hard to fix?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["It comes down to hitboxes. These are imaginary cubes drawn around \"things\" in games. The more detailed the hitboxes are, the more computations need to be done to determine if things collide. Lets say you have a minecraft dude. His hitboxes are simple because he's already a few cubes. Its easy to do the math to determine when one cube hits or intersects or runs into another cube. Or if I shoot your minecraft dude with a gun, all I have to do is aim within the imaginary hotbox cubes that surround your dude. Pretty simple. But as the 3d models of things (your Halo dude, that explody barrel, the monster) get more complex, the less ideal a few cube hitbox is going to be. no, you want the hitbox for your character to match the geometry of your character. If your Halo dude had a simple single hitbox cube, if you got a rocket anywhere in that imaginary cube it would count as a hit. But thats bullcrap because you totally jumped that rocket, it went _between_ your dude's legs. So now, to be more accurate the hitbox model that represents where your dude \"is\" has to be made up of a bunch of smaller geometric shapes. Maybe, the hitbox model of your dude is almost as complex as the visualization model of your dude. But as you add complexity to that model, all the math to calculate whether bullets, rockets, explody things collided or hit your dude, get a lot more complex. And complexity is fine, but there's only so much processing power available, given your game client and the server have to calculate not only whether your dude got hit by that grenade blast, but the other 63 dudes on the server. Its a similar thing to the calculations on how your dude is affected by the geometry of other things. Your guy is leaning up against a wall? If the collision/hitbox model of your guy was really detailed, and the geometry of your dude's model was programmed to do it, you could model individual limbs (nay, in some games with ragdoll physics, individual bones) and how they interact with a wall, a crate, riding that horse... but again, complexity and \"realism\" brings computations. So the guys who write game engines have to strike a balance between \"well maybe the wizard's flowing robes sometimes clip into the wall he's standing next to, but at least a 64 person battle has a decent frame rate\" vs. \"we have simulated character models down to individual chest hairs. But you can only get 2 frames per second.\"", "Vfx student here. From what I know, In order to do that would essentially require creating everything as physics objects or create individual hit boxes for each element in the game. Not easy and can really place a burden on your computer. I am sure there is someone more experienced in this topic, but depending on how detailed the models or elements in the game are, it's just easier to allow clipping in a few of the elements rather than miss a release date or spend money trying to correct the problem. Hope that helps."]}

He wanted to realize wireless power transfer - but that still would have required a power source to run the system. The reason nobody ever put money on his idea was not just the risk of people tapping into it, but also that it's wasteful. Wireless energy transfer over big distance is inevitably going to cause losses, whereas conventional systems with power lines (to which his work contributed a great deal) can achieve great efficiency over long distances. The entire concept of free energy is not pursued by power companies because it's simply not possible.

{"prompt": "Why are semis that carry liquid cylindrical, and not rectangular?\nAn elaboration of the question: I was riding my bike down the road and semi carrying gasoline went by, and I thought, \"why not make a rectangular container, shouldn't it hold more liquid?\". Knowing I don't know anything about that stuff, can someone explain to me why we don't use rectangular semis for liquid transport?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Curved structures are mechanically stronger at storing contents under pressure. The pressure is pushing evenly of all sides of a curved surface, so they are less likely to burst. If you have lines or corners there is uneven distribution of load on the interior of vessel. More info can be found here: URL_0", "* cylinders are stronger than rectangles...liquid loads tend to be heavier and can slosh, putting more strain on the trailer than solid loads * a filled tank of most liquids is already operating at near the maximum load limit, there is little advantage to providing extra space * the shape makes it easier to drain", "Also, most tankers have multiple baffles or compartments in them. The weight transfer from thousands of gallons of liquid sloshing around, can easily overcome braking force and. An also causing roll overs on turns", "Think of it in this way: Most materials are a lot stronger when you pull them and not bend them. Just think of a piece of paper. It can handle a lot of force when you pull it, but it will have literally no resistance for bending it. With metal it is exactly the same, only that metal itself is a lot stronger. When you weld metal together as a tube, it is a clever design, so when you put pressure inside the tube, the tube will try to expand. But to expand, its circumference would have to get bigger. And this means that the force caused by the pressure was converted into \"pulling-force\" circular around the circumference. With a rectangular container this wouldn't work. On the edges, the pressure will try to bend up the edges and usually the container will fail/rip open. But just imagine the rectangular container to be of a very bendable material, like rubber. Now apply pressure inside. As the pressure increases, the rectangular container will deform and end up circular. Because this is the most officiant form."]}
{"prompt": "Why do boy bikes typically have a bar across the top whereas girl bikes do not?\nAn elaboration of the question: And that carries over from kids' bikes to bikes for adults. Just seems to me that, if anything, given human anatomy it would be reversed.

Why is it still common? 2. Why do male bikes have that bar at all?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Women used to wear long dresses to used to have to have to \"step through\" the frame in order to preserve their modesty. Males on the other hand could just pop their leg over the top. The tradition has just been maintained on most commercial bikes.", "It's a carry-over from the days when girls and women only work dresses or skirts-and-blouse outfits. The bar on a \"men's\" bike would make riding one in a dress quite awkward.", "I thought this was a holdover from olden times, when girls' bikes had to accommodate for dresses.", "Because girls traditionally wear skirts and dresses which get pushed up by the bar on boys bikes. In Scotland boys bikes also have the low crossbar because of the tradition of wearing kilts.", "As for 2, it's because of physics. Both men and women's bikes have the bar, which is necessary to form a truss in the central bike structure which is far, far stronger than just a single pipe. The only difference is the women's bar connects much lower than the men's, which structurally makes it weaker. This is due to a combination of men being physically heavier and that stereotypically men do more mountain biking/crazy outdoor stunts which would require the stronger frame. Where or not that's really true, men's bikes are actually the better design from a strength standpoint, and the altered frame on women's bikes is a concession due to the whole skirt thing and it's stuck around for marketing purposes.", "Women used to wear dresses/skirts. They still do, but they used to too. The design of the front half of a bike is referred to as the \"front triangle\" (the portion of the frame from the forks to the seatpost). Triangles are the strongest shape in nature because forced is added/displaced equally on all three sides. The step-through frame, generally regarded as a \"woman's\" bike was to allow a woman to get onto the bike while wearing a dress/skirt (they are different things). The ability to use a bicycle was hugely liberating for women when first introduced. While the step-through allowed women (and those with hip issues) the ability to get on a bike, structurally the frame is not as strong as the triangle (where the top tube is much higher). There was the [Penny in Yo Pants initiative]( URL_0 ), demonstrating a trick using pocket change to allow women in skirts to ride bicycles. There isn't really anything in cycling that is \"gender specific\". Men and womens seats now have options that have no center channel. Beyond that, it's just a matter of frame size - cranks, gears, wheels, handlebars (incl. tape) is a lot of personal preference and bike fit.", "I used to rent bikes. Low step are still good now particularly for people with hip or leg issues. I had an elder man renting specifically request the low step option for this reason. Also good for people who might lose their balance swinging a leg around, and of course, riding in compromising clothing. WSD options (low step) typically have a shorter distance from person to handle bars. This smaller space was built intentionally with women and their shorter wing span in mind. Personally I like having the bar there, and I do happen to have a longer wing span, so I typically take the male option of bikes."]}
{"prompt": "If coaxial is good enough to get the signal inside, why do we use all kinds of other connections (HDMI, Ethernet etc...)\nAn elaboration of the question: Had some new services installed in my home recently and realized that they used coaxial cable for every service (TV, phone, Internet). I remember coaxial always being used for the TV, but it used to be a cable that just went straight into the TV. Then it changed to a cable going in a box that then hooked up to the TV. Now its the same but the box connects via HDMI instead of coaxial. Internet same thing, coaxial runs into the modem and then uses ethernet cables after that. Phone has its own modem which also then uses regular phone like jacks and connectors. But if Coaxial is what is importing all these signals into the house in the first place, why not standardized everything to run through coaxial inside the house as well?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["The coaxial signal is very high frequency analog. It takes significant electronics to decode it and encode an outgoing signal. The box that does this is called a modem (MOdulator-DEModulator). If you add that electronics to every thing, it would significantly increase the cost, over a digital system like HDMI. High frequency analog signals are also subject to cosite interference when you have more than one of them inside a box, so things would need lots of metal boxes to put the components in. Net result, it would cost a lot more.", "Because coax is essentially carrying radio signals, and anything working over it includes a full radio transceiver. Essentially it's much more similar to using wifi cards. You could replace your Ethernet connection with wifi cards connected via coax instead of antennas, it would probably work, but it's much more expensive than Ethernet, and significantly slower. It's a similar issue with HDMI, a current HDMI cable can be powered by a $25 raspberry pi zero (so whatever HDMI needs is less than that), but HDMI handles 48Gbps of data, much much more than your $100 cable modem is capable of. While a cable modem using current tech can be made to push 48Gbps over coax, it would really require 100 times the hardware to generate the right signals, making it a $10k modem, and you need one on each end of the cable.", "Because each of those things have specific standards (physical and electrical) that were developed independently - many of them prior to the introduction of consumer Internet services from cable TV companies. Phones, for example, have used the same cabling, modular connectors, and signalling for 40+ years. Could you run phones directly over coax? Sure, but what would the benefit be compared to the expense of abandoning millions of existing phones. Years ago, we used to run Ethernet over coaxial cable. However, coax tends to be bulky and hard to work with, and the devices used to propagate the signal introduce multiple failure points to the network. So, networking switched over to twisted pair cable in the late 80s/early 90s. TP wiring is easier to work with and is less expensive than coax. HDMI was developed in the early 2000s, to provide higher quality digital AV between devices. It's no coincidence that HDMI came on the heals of wider adoption of DVD, and was developed around the same time as Blu-Ray. Each of the standards is optimized for its specific function and, after the cable comes into your home, the signals the cable company sends must be converted, by your modem, into the type that can be used by the connected device.", "Another piece of insight here. From what I remember from college. The coaxial cable is essentially lossless. It can be run for miles and miles without signal degradation. You can't do that with ethernet. For simplicity sake, essentially you can't run Cat5e more than 100 meters (~300+ feet) at a time without a repeater to regenerate the signal and send it out again. Cat6 is the same at 1000base-T but it's more often used for 10GBase-T, or 10 gigabit per second rate, which means its maximum distance is about 55 meters. HDMI is the same story, topping out at 50 feet before signal degradation. [Here's a decent source]( URL_1 ) Notice the RG-59 Coax doesn't show a max length. IIRC from college, that's thanks to shielding and most importantly, impedance matching. [Wikipedia sources for support]( URL_0 ) Especially the \"matched load\" section there where it says \"for all l.\" If you tried to do the same thing that Coax is used for by using ethernet cables, it would cost you a fortune in repeaters alone. You can't do everything with Coax either. It has limits on splits. It's better for getting signal between 2 points, but not well suited for your network backbone like ethernet. There are pros and cons to all types of cables and their usefulness depends on application needs."]}

Now we use glasses without any coloration. How did this change happen? Did we discover new way to make 3D films?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["The key idea of any 3d is to project 2 images on to the screen, and have each eye register only one of them. With red/blue, you would show one image in only blue color, and another image in only red color, using different shades of red. If you looked at the entirely-red-shades image through lens that was color red, you would see just, well, red. But if you saw it through blue lens, you would see all the different shades. Likewise for blue. Thus, you get(with wonky colors) 2 different images, one for each eye, which then could be used to do 3d. Modern tech however uses polarization, that is, the direction light is sorta \"waving\" at. Light is a wave, and it has direction, orthogonal to the direction it's going, where it's \"waving\" at. Typically white light does this waving thing in all sorts of directions, and it's a mess, but there are filters which can block all but certain orientation of this waving. Having one image transmitted only using light that's of certain orientation, and then have lenses of your glasses selectively block these orientations allows again you to transmit only one of the two images to both eyes. I don't know how expensive this new polarization technique is, but I can tell you that you can do pretty good job with this red/blue lens thing with very cheap materials, video device you use to show your red/blue 3d film has absolutely no special requirements, and it's pretty cheap to make appropriate glasses, so that probably explains why people historically did use this red/blue 3d thing despite color problems.", "Polarized light is the secret. To your eye, polarized light looks like normal light. Normal light has waves, right? Normally, these waves kinda bounce every which way. But with a filter, you can ensure the waves only go one way, for example vertical. So what the 3D projector does is show two images, one composed of vertically poliarized light, one of horizontally polarized light, on top of each other. One glasses lens filters the one polarization, and the other filters the other polarization. So each eye now sees a different image. [Here's a handy lil diagram]( URL_0 ). For the other lens, the opposite would be true, the horizontal light would get past the filter but the vertical would not."]}

In a room of the building, conneceted to the solar panels, are four large batteries. These batteries are similar to those you would find in a car but are larger and can store more electricity. The excess electricity not used by the building is pushed into and stored in these batteries. This means we can access that supply of electricity when the Sun is not in the sky or on cloudy days. In the event that the batteries were full and we weren't using any electricity, the solar panels system would stop generating electricity until it was needed again.", "Solar panels will act as a heater if the power is not used. Similar to how an engine that is not connected to anything will just make heat and noise. The electricity will just be heating up the wires and the panels themselves.", "It doesn't generate power that it doesn't use. Sunlight displaces electrons in the solar panel. If those electrons can't go anywhere then as each electron is moved there are fewer electrons left behind to move. Meanwhile the abundance of displaced electrons makes moving more electrons more-and-more difficult. Soon the sunlight is not moving any electrons at all. This is the same reason that batteries don't discharge (as fast) when the device they are in is turned off. It's also why your car battery might be _able_ to push \"500 cold-cranking amps\" but it is not normally moving anywhere near that much current. So the sunlight is a mechanical force.

If nothing is using that voltage... if no \"current\" is being drawn... then the forces of electricity and sunlight reach equilibrium and the cells do _nothing_. So if your building has the _potential_ to generate twice as much power as it uses... it still only _actually_ generates as much power as it uses, and the extra potential is just meaningless. What normally happens in such a design is that you add batteries to store some energy for darker times, or you hook up to the grid and generate 100% of your potential, use half, and sell the other half to the grid. In other terms, I can reasonably lift fifty pounds, but I rarely lift more than ten. It's improper to ask \"what happened to the other forty pounds\" because they don't exist. That forty pounds didn't \"go anywhere\". It was never there at all. Same for the capacity of the panels to generate XXX current. If you only use the lessor YY current, then that's all that's generated. Same for your house on the grid. The grid _could_ supply enough power to melt your entire house in bright electric arcs. But since you never ask it for that kind of power it never happens. (And we have circuit breakers and fuses that prevent that request being filled if you should have something break and so ask for that kind of power.) So that's why turning off appliances and lights \"saves power\" by eliminating the place where such power might go, and so eliminating its actual production. TL;DR :: Electricity, when it piles up has \"back-pressure\" because that's how \"electrical charge\" works. That back-pressure slows or stops the generation of electricity in solar panels so that only as much as you use can actually be generated."]}

Hypergolic means that the two substances react with each other nearly instantaneusly without any other input producing a flame that in turn will ignite the propellent and start the engine."]}
{"prompt": "Why do screws/bolts/nuts get loose and have to be tightened, in the first place?\nAn elaboration of the question: It happens so often, you have a mechanical problem because a bolt holding two things together has become loose, letting something wiggle around.

It doesn't ever seem there's any pressure on the join in the direction that would cause a screw to turn, but they're always farther down the threads than you left them.\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["It can be caused by many different things. It has to do with motion of course. I have a wooden chair I use all the time. It squeaks and twists and after about 6 months a screw will fall out and I'll tighten them all up. It's just wear and tear really. Even on industrial machines rattling or a motor vibration will over time but very slowly push the screws out."]}

Usually expensive items have some sort of theft prevention device that consists of a large magnet that can only be removed at the registers; if you don't buy it, it's not removed, and sets the alarm off.", "So it seems no one actually answered both questions. The scanners are just cameras that look at a bar code and take the pattern of the white lines and converts them into a number that the computer can find in a database to match to a product. The different spacing and thicknesses change the value. The alarms at the door are scanning for rfid tags. They send out a radio signal that the rfid tags respond too. When the tags receive the signal they use it to power up a weak response signal that the alarms scan for. The magnets they swipe the tags over just wipe out the rfid tags."]}

{"prompt": "Technical debt\nAn elaboration of the question: what is this? A lot of my engineers at work talk/complain about it but I don't really understand the concept\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Technical debt is the software engineering buzzword for taking shortcuts that come back to bite you later. Now, maybe you *had* to take a shortcut to launch your thing on time, or maybe you're just a lazy POS. In my experience in software, it's a 50/50 mix. Here are some possible types of technical debt (not an exhaustive list): * Lack of tests. This is important for projects with large teams because the original author of some code isn't necessarily going to be there to review changes from other team members. The reason this is debt is because future well-intentioned changes could cause a regression in behavior, which will waste significantly more time with rolling back builds, finding culprit changelists, rolling back code (or fixing forward, not recommended 99% of the time), finding the bug, and rolling forward. * Poor encapsulation. Encapsulation is the idea that a chunk of code should be mostly self-contained, with anything not self-contained being established and documented. Think of it like an electrical system in a house: External influences are well documented (different plug types), the main logic lives in one spot (breaker box). However, let's now imagine that, because it was easier to do at the time and it saved construction time (somehow), the only way to reset your breaker box is to flush your toilet. This would be an example of poor encapsulation. (Now let's say you had to replace your toilet, and... oh no, you have to completely unwind your electrical system to be able to get at the toilet. Looks like a weekend project just became a 2 week project.) * Hacks. A hack is a form of a shortcut taken because it's trivially easy to do, even if not a great idea. [Here is an example of a hack outside of software.]( URL_0 ) This could be a fairly well-contained hack (like say calling a function that hits your server infinitely until it works instead of backing off if you detect an outage, since you just have to delete that one chunk of code and rewrite it), or it could be systemic (\"If I just give the whole application access to these bytes, it will be way easier to set them from all over the application,\" now you have to rewrite your whole application to fix it). Hacks are incredibly insidious in code, and often lead to more hacks. If a hack is fixed right away, then the cost of the hack was the time spent adding the hack plus the time spent doing it right. Often times, laziness or downward pressure from leadership results in people adding more hacks to work around existing hacks. If you wait long enough for more code to depend on the hack, now you have to spend the time to redo everything around it right, in addition to the spent doing the original thing right. I've seen many projects at my place of employment slowly die due to accruing technical debt. As it grows, your ability to get work done in a timely manner shrinks, until you're spending 3 months getting something done that should have taken a week at most.", "It's a common agile software term. When you start making part of a program before other parts, you do work (spend $) and you get a part of the software. Let's say it's 1/2 of the software. Later on, when you're figuring out the next chunk of software, you notice that 10% of the code you already made has to be redone. This \"technical debt\" of 5% of your project is a debt you took on (perhaps without intending to) when you implemented the first half of the code."]}

Why is this?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["The fastest innovations in tech are in the area of computers and software. The reason innovation happens so fast in that space is that the cost to building and trying out an idea is so small. If you think of an idea, you can try it out and build it right away.

{"prompt": "How does an AA gun or a flak gun work?\nAn elaboration of the question: In movies where air battles or bombings occur there are typically anti air guns shooting up at the planes.

What determines when the flak round will explode, what causes the round to explode, etc.\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Early models of flak shells had what /u/_YourPariah_ had. You figured out the altitude of the aircraft, then adjusted the timer on the shell to explode at the appropriate height. During the Second World War, the US and UK developed the Proximity Fuse, which worked like u/fofwalker says. Those shells detected an aircraft nearby and exploded. The new fuse was so secret, it was forbidden to use them on the continent for fear the Germans would get their hands on them. URL_0", "I believe there's a timer in the rounds. Since you know how fast the round travels, it's pretty easy to calculate X number of seconds equals y number of feet in the air.", "I'm no expert but I always thought that they had little radar devices inside of the rounds that would explode into shrapnel when near an airplane.", "*I'm assuming you're talking about large calibre flak (such as the 8.8cm) and not lower calibre anti-aircraft guns that work the same as normal guns.* Flak shells in WW2 had 2 types of fuses, either a timed fuse or a barometric fuse. The timed fuse is pretty self explanatory and detonates when the timer expired. The barometric fuse on the other hand detonated when a certain (set) altitude was reached.", "Timed fuzes, mostly. They generally knew what altitude the planes they were shooting at were flying, and how long it took for their rounds to reach that altitude, so they set a timer. The Allies also had proximity fuzes. They were essentially tiny radars that would detonate the shell when it got close. Very important to the war effort, almost on par with the atomic bomb.", "The shells they are firing up at the planes have an adjustable fuse that can be set before firing to explode at different altitudes.

{"prompt": "Why are radiators often located beneath window shelves?\nAn elaboration of the question: Seems to me like more heat would escape the room when the source is located in the least insolated part of the room, which furthermore has less mass to retain the heat than a wall. Or is my science incorrect? Please explain\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["you are almost right - it is usually the coldest spot in your room. But that also means, that this is the part of the room that is the hardest to heat. If you'd put the radiator at the other end of the room you'd have a very warm and cozy part of the room and the freezing part of the room right next to the windows. And to get the cold corner to a nice temperature you'd have to make the warm part of the room even warmer. Putting the radiator at the window leads to a more evenly distributed warmth in a room.", "There are many reasons why. As said already, it helps with the heat distribution of the room by creating a warm buffer near the window to help minimize heat loss. This pocket of warm air insulates the rest of the room from drafts coming from the outside. It also helps decrease the amount of condensation on the window by keeping it warm enough to not reach the dew point. Space is also something to consider. Normally the area below a window is unused space so it makes sense to place the radiator there rather than take up space on another wall."]}
{"prompt": "Why aren't cars more fuel efficient?\nAn elaboration of the question: The small Japanese family cars of the 1970s were pulling 30-40 miles per gallon on carbureted, naturally-aspirated engines that had to be throttled to produce any performance. Yet today, with direct injected, turbocharged, electronically managed engines, fuel efficiency remains pretty similar. What gives?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Things I learned during my Mechanical Engineering degree: * **Competing Factors**: Fuel efficiency isn't necessarily correlated with other positive attributes, like safety, cost, reliability, emissions, and engine characteristics. Designing a vehicle requires compromises between these factors. * **Emissions Standards**: Fuel emission standards need to be pretty universal. For example, Los Angeles is affected a lot more by high emissions than Denver, so car manufacturers abide by policies that lower emissions universally for the sake of L.A., even if it reduces fuel efficiency. It's an intertwining of politics and economics. For those who might be confused as to why fuel efficiency isn't always correlated to emissions: depending on several factors, an engine can emit different levels of various particulates, some of which are really damaging to the environment and public health."]}
{"prompt": "Pipeline regulations\nAn elaboration of the question: I understand oil spills are detrimental to our environment but so is transferring oil by truck.

It seems like better regulations/ punishment would be the solution. Why isn't that talked about more?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Depends on the country and the regulator, which also depends on where the pipeline is going to, and whether it's onshore or subsea. Here in Australia, you're required to develop a Pipeline Management Plan (PMP) that covers all aspects of the pipeline, e.g.: - Route planning. - Soil erosion and subsidence. - Thermal effects. - Construction (material selection, welding methodology, installation, compression and transmission, integrity verification). - Maintenance (corrosion control, inspection, non-destructive testing). - And, at the end, decommissioning and environmental reconstruction. As for are they doing enough, well, in most cases yes. The majority of pipeline discharges are unrelated to the pipeline itself. Most common is people drive into them, or drag marine anchors over them, or they get dislodged or damaged during severe weathers. Hell, in Nigeria, the locals come in and cut holes in them to steal buckets of oil out of the pipeline, and in more cases than not it blows them the hell up. BP's Alaska pipeline spill was a direct result of cost-cutting. They scaled back on their maintenance program (especially pigging - where you run essentially a drone down the pipe and check corrosion and wall thickness), the pipe corroded and pissed crude oil out of the ground."]}

It could withstand down to 4 °C but ambient temperatures were -2.2 to -1.7 °C. Ultimately the failure of the o-ring destroyed the craft. For the Columbia disaster a piece of foam insulation broke off the external tank and struck the left wing of the shuttle. This meter-long piece of foam broke off when the craft was traveling at about 2,600 kph and likely caused a 15-25 cm hole in the wing. Upon reentry into the atmosphere this gap in the shielding allowed hot gasses to enter the wing and destroy the craft."]}
{"prompt": "How do transistors work and be the size of a atom?\nAn elaboration of the question: I don't really understand how transistors work. I read they are like doors, if they are how is that any different then a switch? How can transistors be so small and still function, I read we can make single atom transistors and even subatomic transistors. Bonus question: I could be wrong but it seems the vacuum tube turned into the transistor. Are they wired and function the same way but a transistor is just smaller. Like moving from wires to PCB or entirely different.\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["The operation of a vacuum tube is a lot like a Field Effect Transistor (FET), but the actual mechanism of operation is a bit different. And the construction is very different. Transistors are \"solid state\"...there's no vacuum (or moving parts). So transistors are much more reliable and \"shrinkable\". One of the great things about transistors was that people figured out how to manufacture a bunch of them at the same time in a circuit configuration (an \"Integrated Circuit\", or IC). Then they figured out to make the whole circuit smaller, and smaller, and smaller. This is what enabled the microelectronics revolution over the last 50 years. Sometimes people describe transistors as little switches, but this is not quite accurate. They are actually little amplifiers, but we *use* them like little switches in digital electronics. (In analog electronics, we use them like little amplifiers, which is what they are.) In a FET, there are 3 connections. How much current passes between the Source and Drain connections is controlled by the voltage put on the Gate connection. (There's actually a 4th connection, but we can neglect it for this description.) So you can amplify a small signal by putting it on the Gate and letting it control a large current between the Source and Drain. In digital logic, you either put a very little voltage on the Gate, or a lot. So the SD current is either very little, or a lot. In this way, the transistor acts like a switch, except the switch isn't controlled by anything mechanical, it is controlled by the Gate voltage. The smallest transistor I've ever hear of is a [quantum dot]( URL_0 ), or perhaps a [single-electron transistor]( URL_1 ). These are still in their infancy, and I don't understand them enough to describe them. They don't really work like the ubiquitous FET that are in so many things today. In today's FETs, some of the materials are down to one atomic layer *thick*. But the whole transistor is still larger than an atom."]}
{"prompt": "why do you need a GFCI receptacle in wet places when it provides the same function as a circuit breaker?\nAn elaboration of the question: The magnetic part of a circuit breaker should trip when there's a short circuit. I fail to see how this is any different *in effect* than a \"ground fault\". Is it just the matter of it taking a few microseconds longer to react than a GFCI, or what?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["A circuit breaker trips when too much current is detected. Here \"too much\" is on the order of 15 *amps*. By the time the breaker trips it's far too late for the person being shocked. GCFI trips if the current imbalance exceeds a *much* lower value, around 0.006 amp.", "A circuit breaker only shuts off if excess current is drawn through it. In most cases a short circuit between the hot and neutral will cause excess current to flow causing the breaker to trip. If there is a short between the hot and ground, again it should cause the breaker to trip. However if there is a short between the hot and some other ground path outside of the circuit, it might not cause excess current to flow. This could still be incredibly dangerous because you can be seriously injured or killed from as little as 0.05A Most home circuits in the US are 15A. So as you can plainly see, the circuit breaker will do nothing to help in this case. The Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter on the other hand compares the current flowing through the hot to the current returning on the neutral. If the two are not the same, then some current must be leaking out of the circuit somewhere else and that is clearly a dangerous fault condition.", "A circuit breaker will trip on a fault current equal to the rated value in 10 or 15 minutes. An overload twice that would trip in a few seconds. A person will fry badly in that time. A GCFI trips in a few hundredths of a second. That's fast enough to prevent injury."]}

{"prompt": "What is the difference between the various semi-automatic gun mechanisms?\nAn elaboration of the question: I know roughly how they work (the expanding gas is used to push the slide or bolt back) but I have no idea the difference between short vs long blow back, blow forward, direct vs indirect impingement, recoil, etc. I can't find great visual differences, and the Wikipedia articles are pretty technical and assume that I know more about the internals than I do.\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["The most simple form is straight blowback Straight blowback works by having an unlocked bolt behind the round in the chamber. when the gun is fired the gas pressure exerts a force on the bolt and it is forced away from the chamber. As it moves rearwards the empty case is pulled out. When the bolt reaches the rear of it's travel it moves forward again using the force stored in the recoil spring. On the way forwards it strips a new round from the magazine and pushes it into the chamber ready to fire again. The main disadvantage of blowback firearms is that the only thing keeping the bolt in battery (against the chamber) is the inertia of the bolt. In order to be safe the case needs to be supported in the chamber until the pressure in the chamber has dropped (after the bullet has left the barrel). As the power of the round being fired increases the mass of the bolt must increase. Delayed blowback is similar in operation except there will be some mechanism that will increase the inertia of the bolt without adding mass. For example the roller delayed blowback system used in the HK MP5 sub machinegun and G3 rifle or the lever delayed system used in the FAMAS rifle. The mechanism generally works by having a two part bolt having some method of forcing one half to move faster than the bolt face thus giving the bolt assembly more inertia than a one piece bolt of the same mass. Blow forward is the opposite of blowback. The bolt is in a fixed position and the drag of the bullet travelling through the barrel pulls the barrel forwards off the empty case. As the barrel reaches the end of it's forward travel the empty case is ejected and the barrel returns under spring pressure. As it travels back it collects a new round and chambers it. This method of operation is extremely rare and was only used in a few firearms Recoil operation means that when the gun is fired the bolt and barrel both move backwards together. This gives the bullet more time to leave the barrel than a blowback design. There are two main types of recoil operation: short recoil and long recoil. Short recoil operation means that the barrel and bolt are locked together when in battery and only travel a short distance before the barrel unlocks from the bolt. After this happens the barrel stops and the bolt continues. The empty case is ejected and the bolt returns forward collecting a new round and chambering it. The bolt gets to the barrel and moves it forward into the locked position ready to fire again. Most semi-auto pistols use a short recoil action with a browning tilting barrel design which works by locking the barrel into the slide via locking lugs above the chamber. As the barrel moves rearward it drops down which disconnects it from the slide. For example see the 1911. Other short recoil systems include the toggle locked (luger pistol) and rotating barrel (gsh18, beretta px4). Long recoil operation means that when the gun is fired both the bolt and barrel travel all the way to the end of travel. At this point the bolt stays at the rear and the barrel returns to the forward position. When the barrel slides off the empty case which is held by the bolt the case is ejected and the bolt then moves forward collecting a new round and chambering it. An example of this is the Browning A5 shotgun. Gas operated firearms use tap some gas from a port in the barrel and use it to operate the gun. Gas operated firearms can be put into 2 categories: direct impingement and piston operated. Direct impingement firearms work by blowing gas directly at the bolt carrier which then moves rearward unlocking the bolt and ejects a round. For example the AG m/42 rifle. An alternative is the system used in the AR10 and AR15 rifle which is where gas is tapped off the barrel and directed into the bolt carrier via the gas key. Once inside the carrier it expands in the space behind the bolt (which has a gas piston and rings at the rear) causing the bolt carrier to move rearward and unlock the bolt and then carry it the the rear. If memory serves this system was originally called an \"expanding gas system\" but is usually called direct impingement now. Gas piston systems work by directing gas from the barrel and using it to push a piston which moves the bolt carrier to operate the firearm. There are two types: short stroke and long stroke systems. Short stroke is where the piston only travels a short distance just enough to give the bolt carrier a kick which sets it into motion. Examples of this are the HK G36 rifle, FN SCAR rifle and the Steyr Aug Rifle. Long stroke is where the piston is attatched to the bolt carrier and travels all the way to the rear and all the way forward again. For example the AK47 rifle and M1 Garand rifle. Two different ways that the bolt can unlock are by tilting or rotating. All the rifles I mentioned previously as examples of gas piston systems all have rotating bolts. Examples of tilting bolts are the VZ58 rifle and the FN FAL. Other actions exist too, I forget the name but there is a gun that used a combination blow forward/blow back action. Also check out the Mateba auto revolver."]}

{"prompt": "Why does such an important feature as a planes transponder not work like the planes flight data recorder and be much harder to turn off and have it's own backup power supply?\nAn elaboration of the question: I understand the FDR can be removed from the planes power supply by removing the circuit breaker, but it will then use it's own local power supply. Why does the transponder seem have a less strict \"up time\" policy applied to it by it being able to be turned off and having no localised power supply?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Because the transponder isn't as critical to the operation of an airplane. The main purpose of a transponder is to make it easier for air traffic control to tell which airplane is which, and to relay altitude information. If the transponder fails, the pilot has to verbally relay that information, which slows things down. But a plane can land just fine without a transponder. A transponder is not designed for locating a plane after a crash. It can be used that way in an emergency if it survives the crash, but that is not what it is for. Finally, if a transponder becomes faulty, it can broadcast bad information and interfere with other aircraft, so it is important for a pilot be able to turn it off as necessary."]}

I can't see the burglar hiding behind my ottoman no matter how hard I squint, unless I move my position. So then how does a fixed-position radar build this top-down view? How does it discriminate between the front side of a cloud, the back side of a cloud, the sides of the cloud, the sides of the cloud behind that, etc.? Right now in my area there are like hundreds of layers of clouds just in one direction. I look at the map top-down and I can see how a radar could figure it out from my earth-orbit POV, but the radar is on the ground, not in space. I can't imagine every beam is able to report its complete itinerary back to the station like \"I bounced from position A to B ... to Z and then finally back to you for good\"...so how does this work?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["> I can't imagine every beam is able to report its complete itinerary back to the station like \"I bounced from position A to B ... to Z and then finally back to you for good\"...so how does this work? And yet it does! Or, more exactly, the radar shoots out a pulse. Then it opens its eyes and starts looking for reflections. Every nanosecond it sees how much of a reflection it gets. And because it knows how fast light travels, and of course it knows what direction it's looking in, it knows where that reflection came from. (It knows that it must be a direct reflection because it looks at the strongest signal it got, which is practically speaking almost impossible to be a multipath reflection). If it gets a strong reflection 50,000 nanoseconds after it emits the pulse, it knows it's hitting a cloud at about 25,000 feet away (light travels about 1 foot in 1 nanosecond)."]}
{"prompt": "what in the audio jack’s design makes the iPhone more prone to water damage than the lightning port?\nAn elaboration of the question: One reason that’s cited for getting rid of the audio jack on smartphones is that the audio jack makes them especially vulnerable to water damage. But there are other orifices on smartphones, too. On the iPhone there’s the lightning port millimetres from the audio jack. How is the lightning port doing better when it comes to water damage?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["> But there are other orifices on smartphones, too. Whenever you have a port in a container such as a smartphone the efforts to secure it against water intrusion are going to have a certain rate of failure. Whatever the rate is the fewer ports the lower the risk to the device as a whole. Obviously they can't get rid of the lightning port but if lightning can do everything the 3.5 mm audio jack can do then removing it would be expected to lower rates of water damage. Note that this holds true regardless of if the audio port is any easier to secure against water or not. I think there are more compelling arguments in favor of the move though. For example the lightning port has the potential to provide superior sound quality compared to a normal audio jack. Why? The lightning port can provide external power to connected devices by drawing from the internal battery. This can power amplifiers and various audio processing hardware in the connected devices, as well as things like active noise cancelation which would otherwise require power storage integrated into the devices themselves at the cost of increased weight, the cost of complexity, and the need to charge more devices. Obviously something like USB-C might be an even better solution but the lightning cable has been around for four years now while USB-C is still picking up steam."]}

Today on earth we rely heavily on GPS to navigate around or via maps created with satellites or drawn by hand (ancient).

I guess putting satellites around the planet is one way to do it but imagine it won't be cost effective or great way to spend resources if we intend to get around ;-).

{"prompt": "What's counter torque and why is it needed to make a helicopter fly?\nAn elaboration of the question: I once asked someone about how propellers can make an object fly. He said that without counter torque, no helicopter can fly no matter how fast the propeller was spinning. So what exactly is counter torque?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["A helicopter flies by using an engine to spin a primary rotor, but that rotor has inertia so when trying to spin it there is a force pushing back that tries to spin the helicopter body too. Counter torque is provided by the tail rotor and ensures that only the main rotor rotates around the shaft and the body of the helicopter isn't also spinning around the shaft. This is why a helicopter that loses the tail rotor starts spinning out of control", "Remember Newton's third law of motion? Each action has an equal and opposite reaction. Imagine a helicopter with no tail rotor, and the main rotor spins counter clockwise. The helicopter's body will spin opposite to the helicopter's blades. So without a tail rotor, the body will just keep turning clockwise. In order to stabilize the body from turning in circles constantly, the tail rotor provides a force that pushes the helicopter's tail counter-clockwise, balancing out the torque provided by the main rotor. [Here's a video on YouTube that provides a visual example and explains the mechanics behind a tail rotor.]( URL_0 ) There are helicopters without tail rotors, but they have some sort of mechanism at the tail that produces the same effect a tail rotor does: provide a force at the tail opposite the helicopter's spin.", "People here are mixing up the air resistance of the rotor with the torque from the engine. The torque that makes the helicopter spin comes from the engine spinning the rotor. If the rotor spins and is braked by air resistance no torque is applied to the body. This is actually very important, as it allows you to do an autorotation (landing without engine power) if the tail rotor fails. . Also there are helicopter designs that do fly without any sort of tail rotor or torque compensation. E. G. You can pump gas through the blades, that comes out at the tip of the blade pointing backwards. This induces no torque on the body URL_0", "The main rotor is constantly cutting into the air in one direction. If there was nothing bracing the body of the helicopter it would start turning in the other direction. Just like if you try to push something heavy while standing on a slippery surface you could go backwards, instead of pushing the object forward. A helicopter has a vertical rotor on the back to counter the spinning of the main rotor."]}
{"prompt": "How does the accelerator pedal in cars work?\nAn elaboration of the question: I have two theories in my mind but they can be both wrong. 1st theory: When the pedal is pushed a little, the car accelerates and then remain at a certain constant speed if the pedal is maintained at the same position. If the pedal is pushed further, the car accelerates and then remain at a higher constant speed as long as the pedal is maintained at the same position. 2nd theory: When the pedal is pushed a little, the car keeps accelerating at a slow rate and speed keeps changing at a slow rate. If the pedal is pressed further, the car keeps accelerating at a faster rate and speed keeps changing at a fast rate.\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["In most cars, pushing the accellerator (or gas ) pedal increases the flow of fuel to the engine. This means the engine will output more power, causing the car to accellerate. However, this accelleration doesn't continue forever. Mainly because as a car's speed increases, the amount of wind resistance increases as well, that's like a force pushing against the car forcing it to slow down. So when you press the accellerator, the engine will push the car harder, and as it speeds up, the air will push harder against it. Once they reach an equilibrium, the car stops accellerating and instead maintains a constant speed.", "In new cars it's electronic. You push it and it tells the engine how much gas and oxygen to let in (for combustion). Older cars have a cable attached to the pedal that connects to the throttle body (lets air in the engine). My pushing the pedal it in return pulls the cable and opens the throttle body butterfly valve. More oxygen = more power, so the more you push the pedal the more oxygen gets sucked in which in turn accelerates the car."]}
{"prompt": "How does a jet engine provide reverse thrust when landing?\nAn elaboration of the question: I searched but didnt really find a proper explanation (though i may be using the wrong terms) I look out the window and I see that the shrouding of the engine kind of folds back to the outlet of the jet and I guess maybe redirects it forward... Ok... but isnt all of that air its redirecting being sucked in from the front to begin with? So even if the redirection were 100% efficient (surely not) it would be a net zero thrust? So where does the reverse thrust actually come from? bonus question, how much good does it actually do? I mean... seems like it must be a fair amount of complexity and weight on the aircraft, plus the token amount of fuel, to shave a few feet off the landing distance? Wouldnt it be better to just let the existing brakes do the job if the runways can contain it? (or cant they?)\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Jet engines work by dramatically increasing the speed of air flowing through them, using a fairly simple design. Air flowing into the front of the engine exits the back at a much increased speed. This is why engines can generate thrust from a standstill. When \"target type\" thrust reversers are deployed, they redirect the flow of the gas exiting the engine to point it in the direction of travel, which results in reverse thrust and slowing of the aircraft. Regarding why they are used - several reasons. Firstly to reduce the wear on brakes, thus avoiding potential failures; secondly to reduce the landing distance; and thirdly to compensate for the negative effect of poor weather on braking efficiency."]}
{"prompt": "How do sailboats / ancient ships steer if the wind isn't blowing in the direction they want to go?\nAn elaboration of the question: Forgive me if my terminology is off. But I've always wondered how long voyages were made given the unpredictable pattern of winds. How are ships able to go where they want if the wind is, say, blowing in the wrong direction?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["A sail can catch wind and push the boat forward from just about any angle greater than 70 degrees from directly in to the wind. A sail boat has a big fin on the bottom that keeps it from being pushed sideways, and the sail is at an angle so the wind is redirected, which all together pushes the boat forward. So as long as the boat isn't going directly into the wind, it can often just sail straight forwards in the direction it wants to go. If the boat wants to travel in to the wind, then what the boat does is it picks up speed going across the wind, and then turns into the wind. While the boat is facing in to the wind, the sail is not catching the wind, so there is much less force trying to slow the boat down as it turns. AS the boat loses speed, it will turn far enough that it is going sideways to the wind again, but in the other direction- and once it picks up enough speed again, it will turn back in to the wind again, which creates a zig-zag pattern that slowly moves them in the direction they want to go. This is known as Tacking in to the wind. Depending on how close to directly in to the wind they want to go, they could just go in mostly the right direction, hoping that the wind will shift in their favor and then tack in to the wind to correct their position once in a while if the wind doesn't change.", "It's called tacking, and basically you zig zag using a portion of the wind to move in the direction you want... so if you were sailing directly into the wind you'd angle the sail so that it moves you up at a 45 degree angle, then switch and have to move you down at a 45 degree angle", "No one yet seems to have mentioned the keel. The keel runs from the front to the back of a boat. The wind, when from the side, just wants to blow the boat sideways, it is the keel that stops that from happening and thus the boat is sort of \"squeezed\" forwards a bit like when you squeeze a toothpaste tube. The toothpaste is channelled by the sides into coming out the front. Same idea."]}

Snap your fingers to the right of your head. Now snap your fingers to the left of your head. [Even if your eyes were closed]( URL_1 ), you would be able to tell which direction the sound was coming from. This is due to **time of arrival differences** of the sound waves. The sound hits one ear or the other milliseconds before the other. Your brain interprets those time of arrival differences and figures out which direction the sound is coming from. With two speakers, or headphones, this is used to make sound appear to come from the far left, panning all the way through the center to the far right. There is no effect to produce \"depth\" using only two speakers. In the 70's, you began to see quadraphonic systems being sold: 4 speakers. This lets the audio engineers pan forward/back in addition to left/right. Quadraphonic setups are better known today as surround sound, where it's not 4 speakers but 5 plus a subwoofer: 5.1. Or 7.1.

I work as a web developer. But as I work for a small company, I just can't fathom data this big. Any insider knowledge, anecdotes and discussion from anyone who works on large databases would be appreciated. Edit: Went to bed, woke up and the blew up. Thanks for all the great discussion, and thanks for the gold.\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["The good news is that data isn't stored in one giant table. It is actually made up of multiple tables. Tools exist that then link those tables and read the information in them fairly effeciently. Oracle, MySQL, etc handle massive amounts of data pretty easily. Because these tools don't actually care what the data is, they just need the reference points, they can quickly retrieve the data. Think of how RAM works: fast switching pointers. This is how you get a user's data out of billions in a table. The software doesn't need to know that the person's first name is JOHN, it just needs to know that that user's pointer is here and it points to that table and then that table points to the next connected bit of data, etc. It is a chain of tables. Again, most of the retreival of the data isn't getting ALL of the data, it is just getting the pointer. That pointer leads to the next pointer, and so forth. Just fast swapping pointers and then one DISPLAY of the data. Big Data as it is termed, is a huge industry specifically for this challenge. It isn't perfect, but an entire industry exists simply to find better ways to store data so that that pointer chain can be processed faster and faster.", "The simplest answer to your question is that the billions of users (and trillions of other pieces of data associated with those users) are stored on a database split across thousands of machines. Every piece of information has an ID associated with it, and each ID maps to a particular portion of the database hosted by a particular set of machines responsible for that portion of the database. Software abstractions allow you to fetch the data associated with various IDs efficiently without worrying about the details of how the data are stored across the machines. If you want more details on Facebook in particular, a good starting point is to look into things they've written about TAO, a system they built on top of MySQL and memcache to manage their distributed data store.", "Background: I work with data for a living. You mentioned the word \"big\", and that's really appropriate here because some data can't be stored on a single logical volume (disk drive). Think of a standard database like a file system on your hard drive. Each element of the database has an index, and you can query the disk via index to retrieve records, kind of like accessing a file on your computer. The database engine keeps a record of where each bit of data is stored, so it can fetch them on request. What happens when you have so many records that indexing them becomes impossible? For example, you might have far more data than can fit on a single drive. Or you might have so many dimensions to your data that indexing it properly becomes too computationally expensive. This is where we transition into \"big data\". Big Data refers to database storage systems that help manage very large or very dimensional data structures. This happens by storing the data itself across multiple drives / volumes, and creating aggregated indexes or \"nodes\" to slice the data for retrieval. The actual mechanics of this can be pretty complicated, but there are drop-in solutions like Hadoop to streamline the process. Depending on how quickly you want the data retrieved, how deep the data is, how many simultaneous calls you expect, and a host of other factors, you'll set the number of nodes accordingly to balance cost (each new aggregation requires disk space and horsepower) and function (more nodes = faster retrieval). You might be surprised by what data actually qualifies as \"big\" data. With proper indexing and partitioning, a SQL DB can handle millions upon millions of records without flinching. On the other hand, a poorly optimized DB can result in slow read times and clunky operation with just a few million transactions. Data is neat!", "Big Data Engineer here. The ELI5 answer is that your data is replicated to multiple machines in easier to handle chunks. Say you have a table with 100 rows. What Facebook does is splits these tables into 5 machines each holding 60 rows. \"But wait, that's 300 rows. Why did my data increase?\" Well because if we had a unit of data in just one place, then you create a bottleneck. If everyone was viewing Elon Musk's FB page, then the one machine with Elon's page wouldn't be able to handle traffic for the other 19 people. By duplicating the data, Elon's FB page can be stored on three different machines. Finally, you have one more machine that routes incoming requests for data. \"Looking for Elon Musk's page? Go to machine A. TheNak1123's page? Go to Machine B. Elon again? Go to Machine C.\" The key point to remember is that storage is cheap. A 1 TB hard disk costs a consumer like you or me 50 bucks. The key resource for these companies is time. By throwing money to buy more computers and splitting up the data, Facebook can efficiently organize and use large quantities of data on the scale of Exabytes (Millions of Terabytes).", "My area of interest also. They have new types of databases that do not store data in row format(NoSQL) this removes the performance constraints on storing such data in a relational database. They also do not use one database but what you get is api's pulling data from many sources e.g there could be a Ugandan facebook user db only. Facebook is the creator of new frameworks such as presto which enable speedy access to data.", "Recognize that 1 billion users is really just a Google and Facebook problem and maybe a handful of others. The basic pieces of relational databases, if used properly, ensure that most of the time you don't actually need to store whole records. You store the bits that are unique and then just keep links to the bits. Then you make sure that you never ask questions that require you to scan the entire database. Think about a library. You don't have to look at every single book to find something specific. You look up the book in the catalogue, get the books call number and then go right to the specific shelf you need. Databases work this way too. The library catalogue is a database index. For those rare cases when you do want to browse in a library, you don't pick random shelves, you arrange the shelves in sections that have books of the same type. So you can browse, but not the whole library. For databases this is partitioning or sharding. Lastly, modern databases can do some special things with indexes when you're not looking for individual records but you want to count things. Most analytics queries aren't actually for individual records but for aggregates. You can define views and indices on particular types of aggregates so that asking those kinds of questions is more like going to one specific shelf in a library instead of scanning all the books one by one. You need good database design, good database admin, and in very rare circumstances brand new tech.", "Layers upon layers of caching, prefetching and denormalized views.

Let's say it's 1000 pieces for a given table; those 1000 pieces are actually on 1000 different servers. Some kinds of systems query this by having a map of which categories are stored on which servers. For example, your username begins with \"abc\", users with \"abc\" are on server database-a. Then you can query database-a for the actual result. This only works with some kinds of data. Some kinds of systems instead send the query to _all 1000 servers_. Since each server only has a small set of data to look through, they can answer relatively quickly, and then the querying software can further comb through the returned results, which leads to getting useful results very quickly. A very common way to do this is [MapReduce]( URL_0 ).", "Hey! I can answer this question. So large data sets, like you see at Facebook or Netflix, are typically stored in a *horizontally scaling* database like Cassandra. Horizontal scaling means that to increase the performance of the database you just add more computers (which I'll call machines from here on out). How does this work? Well, Cassandra is a distributed database system. This means the entire data set is contained on a bunch of different machines, not just one. This is called a cluster. All the machines in the cluster talk to each other to make sure they're all in sync. And when somebody requests data, they can do so from any one of the machines in the cluster. Every time data is saved to the database, we specify what's called a *primary key*. This tells Cassandra exactly which one of the many machines to save the data to. This makes searching faster because we not only break up the large sets of data, but we know exactly where that data sits in the cluster. Think of a primary key as your zip code. We also specify a *clustering key*, which is used to tell Cassandra how to sort all the data on an individual machine. Think of the clustering key as your home address. With the primary key and the clustering key, Cassandra can very quickly find the data you're looking for. To make searching faster, all you have to do is add another machine to the cluster. This decreases the amount of work each machine has to do individually. This is the key concept behind horizontal scaling. Apple, for instance, has about 1000 machines in their cluster. Hope I didn't butcher my explanation.

Caching is another strategy. The fact that you went to your 2010 records probably made some literal hard drives spinning somewhere. But if you are browsing your wall, that was served from fast RAM in a memcache or similar process.

There are lots of kinds of databases, so the exact solution varies a lot whether you use what's commonly referred to as a relational database (Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MS SQL Server), to document databases (MongoDB, CouchDB), graph databases (Neo4J, Atlas), to triple stores (Redland, AllegroGraph, DB2, Jena). But regardless of the kind of database, and the amount of data stored - the trick to storing vast amounts of data is having an efficient way to organize the data in a way you plan to access it. Say you have huge quantities of LEGOS. They come in lots of shapes, sizes, and colors. In order to effectively build something quickly - you need to organize the blocks in a way that makes it easy for you to find. Say you want to build a pile of parts in single color? Well you might just create bins of legos only organized by color since you only care about the color of the part. But then let's say you want to build a tower that uses only 2x6 bricks. You then might organize by shape instead. However what if you needed to build an entire structure that used a specific \"recipe\" calling for specific size, color, shape and quantity of bricks? You might then have a bin for each style of brick, sorting bricks that are of the same shape, color, and size in the same pile. Then organize the piles in a way that you could quickly locate any specific part in quantity very fast. This might be keeping all the same colored bricks close together and organizing those piles from small to large shapes. Big Data is handled no differently. One creates an index into the data in a manner that is equivalent to the way you will search. So regardless of the type of DB system used, if you are searching using color, size, and shape, you create an index of only those things color, size, and quantity with a reference to where the entire piece of data resides.", "High traffic sites are not a simple client-server-database architecture, you have many more components that help deal with the massive amounts of requests that are sent their way. The most useful tools for scaling are ( listed alphabetically ). 1. Caching - avoid hitting the computes as much as possible let the cache handle it 2. CDN (content delivery network) - let the CDN take as much load from their origin and let the edge nodes take take care of it 3. Layering - Put in as many layers as necessary to have resiliency for example, have a layer of servers that detect where the request is coming from ; if request comes from mobile send it to a different service stack than if it comes from desktop or if it as API request etc. Also consider caching at each layer of the stack 4. Load balancing - use as many load balancers as necessary. It is always a good idea to put your servers and databases behind a load balancer When it comes specifically to the database layer, data in database is typically put in different databases based on logical usage. For example, there could it be database hosted on a bunch of linux hosts that stores only user authentication information. There would be another database hosted on many hosts that stores all the posts user has created. This is done for multiple reasons, one of which is that there are limits to the number of connections a database can open before it runs out of connections another reason can be that the type of database used for one usecase might not be the best solution for another type. For example, RDBMS is not a great for transactional data but not so great at analytical data like analyzing social networks etc, you would want to use a graph database for that. And ofcourse, within each logical separation, you can will have the data in the database optimized using partitioning, normalization and indexing etc. Other redditors here have explained this in enough detail, so I am not going to repeat. You can also have multiple logical instance (where each logical instance is a pool (a pool is a collection of single machines or hosts) of database servers on a Solaris/AIX/Linux/Windows etc server), where you might have 10 instances that are read-only and only 1 instance where new data gets written and synced read only instances of the database - how often does a user update their facebook password or username vs how often do they login ? Using the above mentioned tools, architects come up with systems that serve massive traffic. How you use these depends on what your usecase is, analyzing your user behavior on your website and your server/data center capacity etc, which a lot of times boils down to how much will you be reading and how much will you be writing at it logical layer. And if your abstract all these ideas high enough, the main idea here is to to *divide and conquer*. The key is to figure out *what you need conquering* and *how you want to divide* in order to conquer... So I guess that's the ELI5 answer ? ***divide and conquer***.

Every once in a while I get a call in the middle of the night to add another 1TB to a 227TB database... The real answer is indexing, how you organize your data, and technologies like Oracle text, hadoop, and other stuff like that. 8 Billion rows in a table is not out of this world. The best way is to break the data down into pieces (tables) to the point that it's almost annoying. Everything get's an ID and that ID is indexed in it's respective table. Retrieving a ID which is a unique number, is very easy and almost instantaneous. Consider the following case: You are a company that receives computer files and extracts all of the details about each file into a searchable database so that you can easily determine which files are import and which ones are not. If you think about a file, there are lots of important properties you can keep track of and the data is called Metadata. You have: File Size, File Extension, Date Modified, Date Created, Mime-Type, Original File Path, File Name, Directory Name, etc... then you start getting into file type specific attributes... for Microsoft Office files you have Author, Document Title, A flag for Encrypted or not, Office has it's own Date Created and Modified values, version of the document format... I could go on and on and on... when you add emails you can literally have hundreds and hundreds of potential metadata fields. When you have a database of several hundred million files, that can add up to several billion rows of metadata very quickly. So how do you get all the metadata for a file? Let's Look: First you start off with a really simple table: DocumentID| Bates -----|---------- 23459872345 | Some formatted number a person can easily keep track of 23459872346 | PEIGHT-3548-3405 Then you have a table with all of the metadata fields to ID's MID | Description ---|--- 1 | FileName 2 | File EXT 3 | DateMod 4 | DateCreated Now.... how do you organize the actual metadata? Let's look at a table with the metadata for 4 files ID | DocumentID | MID | Value --|----------|---|----- 1 | 23459872345 | 1 | Awwwyeah.gif 2 | 23459872345 | 2 | gif 3 | 23459872345 | 3 | 5/27/2017 02:33 4 | 23459872345 | 4 | 5/27/2017 02:33 5 | 23459872346 | 1 | 06 - the world is mine - david guetta.mp3 6 | 23459872346 | 2 | mp3 7 | 23459872346 | 3 | 12/28/2016 03:12 8 | 23459872346 | 4 | 5/27/2017 03:12 9 | 23459872347 | 1 | IP schema.xlsx 10 | 23459872347 | 2 | xlsx 11 | 23459872347 | 3 | 9/18/2017 01:00 12 | 23459872347 | 4 | 1/1/2017 18:36 13 | 23459872348 | 1 | patch panel plan.xlsx 14 | 23459872348 | 2 | xlsx 15 | 23459872348 | 3 | 10/9/2016 03:41 16 | 23459872348 | 4 | 10/8/2016 23:55 So how do you get all the metadata from a specific file? In the large table the ID column and the document ID column are indexed. So you would search that table by document ID and 4 rows would be returned. If you just wanted the file extension you would throw an AND in there and you would want MID = 2. This is a very simplistic search and explination, but that's how it would work. The real question is.... how do you backup a 227TB database? You don't... you keep it in triplicate using different technologies...."]}

It has a special property of converting different Energies. With pressure it turns into heat, with light it splits light, and with electricity it creates a vibration. Some quartz crystals make a very stable vibration. Imagine one of these quartz could do 1000 times the second perfectly. We learned how to measure that has had to turn that into a clock. You may be familiar with counting seconds as one one thousand or one alligator. Running electricity through a piece of quartz crystal splits one second into to one thousand beats per second. By making a device that can separate every 1000 beats we can create a stable clock.", "Typical household digital clocks do not rely on quartz crystals for timekeeping. These clocks sample the AC voltage from the wall outlet. The frequency of this voltage is very well controlled at 50 or 60 Hz (varies by country) The clock measures the passage of time by counting how many times the electricity cycles. After 50 or 60 cycles, one second has gone by and the clock updates the display accordingly. The power distribution company strives to keep the frequency correct since varying frequency has a negative impact on the performance of the grid. The clock is incredibly accurate because of this. Interestingly, old style electric motor clocks also exhibited high accuracy for the same reason. In this case, though, a synchronous motor is used that spins once for each voltage cycle. 50 or 60 revolutions then equated to one second, so time could be mechanically displayed very accurately."]}

Larger tires will cause your speed to be faster than your speedometer says, and smaller tires will cause you to be slower.", "The old analog gauges used a cable from the transmission to the speedometer. The cable was a long flexible wire inside a housing. The cable would connect to a small gear adapter that connected to the transmission. As you drive the transmission would spin the gears in the adapter this would spin the cable which would spin the speedometer. On modern cars there is a speed sensor on the transmission. It consists of a magnet and a metal toothed ring .As the ring spins it creates a current in the magnetic sensor the speedometer uses this signal to display the correct speed. Tachometers used a cable attached to a rotating part on the engine such as the camshaft. Then they used an electrical signal from the ignition coil. Now they use the same type of sensor as the speedometer. There are usually two sensors that tell the engine computer how fast the engine is spinning. The camshaft and crankshaft sensors. The tachometer uses the signal from one or both of these sensors to display the rpm."]}

Cold working typically creates internal stresses.", "Previous answers are correct. If you mash a piece of metal that's cold, you create microscopic weak points in it, as you are basically ripping apart tiny crystals (extra-strong solid regions) that form within the metal.

Sometimes you can change it's shape by hitting it with a hammer, sometimes you can bend it by hand. Doing this is called working the metal.

{"prompt": "Why is the current in a series circuit with multiple loads constant throughout the circuit? How do the electrons \"know\" to send less current in a circuit with more loads?\nAn elaboration of the question: My teacher explained this concept using Kirchoff's Current Law: since all the current entering a load must come out, a series circuit cannot have different currents in different parts of the circuit. Here's where I get confused: If I hook up a 5V battery to a 1 Ohm resistor, I get 5A of current in my circuit. However, the moment I add another 1 Ohm resistor \"downstream\" of the first resistor, I get 2.5 A of current everywhere in the circuit, even \"upstream\" of the first resistor. Since I'm thinking about this with the water analogy, I'm confused by how the battery \"knows\" that there's an extra load and it better send only half the current. Essentially, I guess my question is how the electron flow automatically changes to fit whatever load is in the circuit.\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["The battery doesn't know anything, the amount of current is determined by the load If i put a 20 pound backpack on you and tell you to go for a run as fast as you can you'll make it in some certain speed If i put an 80 pound backpack on you and tell you to go for a run as fast as you can you'll be going much slower Would it be because you thought \"I am moving more load so i should run slower\" or because you aren't strong enough to move that larger load at the same speed(hint, its the second one) Same thing happens for the electrons. If you put more resistance in the circuit it is harder for them to squeeze around the circuit. Series devices all share the same current because an electron can't move forward without pushing another out of the way so you end up with the same number moving into the battery as out of the battery That last bit works like a straw. If i give you a big straw to blow down its not too challenging, there is some resistance. Now pinch the middle and try to blow, its a lot harder and you can't get as much air through even with more force, that's increased resistance. You're not choosing to get less work done because there is resistance, the resistance is causing you to get less work done", "> Since I'm thinking about this with the water analogy, I'm confused by how the battery \"knows\" that there's an extra load and it better send only half the current. Batteries don't send current. Batteries are a voltage source and (ideally) provide a fixed voltage regardless of the load. For the water analogy, how does a watter tower or pump station know to send more water to your garden hose when you swap the nozzle from the from the wide open high flow one to the narrow low flow one? It doesn't, it just provides a fixed pressure and whatever happens with flow happens. If you open a really really big valve, you will greatly increase flow and cause a pressure drop all the way along the pipe back to the source. The pressure wave travels at the speed of pressure waves, also known as sound. > Here's where I get confused: > If I hook up a 5V battery to a 1 Ohm resistor, I get 5A of current in my circuit. However, the moment I add another 1 Ohm resistor \"downstream\" of the first resistor, I get 2.5 A of current everywhere in the circuit, even \"upstream\" of the first resistor. It doesn't the moment you add a new resistor. He skipping what is known as the transient state and going to the next steady state. He's skipping the actual change process and telling you how it will end up. Let's say we swap a very very fast acting instantaneous switch that makes the resistance somewhere in the circuit higher. At that instant, the electrons in that new resistor, and that new resistor only, start to encounter more resistance and slow down. The rest of the circuit is unaffected. Next, the electrons before the new resistor start to catch up to the slowed down one. Current is higher upstream than it is down stream at this instance. They are like charges, so they repel each other. Them getting closer together is building up a voltage repelling then from getting any closer to each other. This creates a kind of back log, and will propogate backwards upstream all the way to the battery. On the downstream side, thanks to these slowed electrons, the ones ahead of then get further and further ahead. This gap of missing electrons (which are negative) is positively charged and wants to pull these electron back. This also propogates further downstream all the way to the battery. They'll be tugging back and forth and the current will fluctuate up and down all along the circuit as all things try to equalize. Current will not be equally everywhere, in places you will be building up or depleting charge to accomodate this. Eventually, this rippling in the current will settle down to zero and you will have a new steady current in your circuit, the one your teacher is telling you about that obeys KCL. How fast do these changes propogate at? Effectively the speed of light, that's why you can't notice them. The electrons attract and repel each other because they are electrically charged. Electrical chrages interact through voltages and electric field. Speed of light is just the speed a changing electric field propogates at in a vacuum. Inside of a wire is a little slower, but not far off. How long does this transient period last for? Probably millionth or billiotnths of the smallest time frame your brain can proceess. These aren't effects noticable to humans. It's really no different than a traffic jam in a highway. Just because one guy has to slam on the breaks to slow down for something doesn't mean the entire highway will instantly slow to his speed. There's a human reaction time and breaking time and this will propogate backwards as some speed until all the cars behind him slow down. Replace electrons with cars and human reaction time with the speed of light, and you have the circuit. Is your teacher wrong about KCL? No, KCL can be made to hold at all times. What he's skipping over is another two electrical circuit components, capacitors and inductors. Capacitors store charge and let through a displacement current, so all this minute charge build up and seperation would be represented by capacitors. Even if you don't have an actual physical capacitors in your circuit, you resistors and wires have inherent capacitance and inductance and to properly model it would have the actual physical resistor replaced with an ideal resistor and an ideal capacitor. Why did he skip capacitance and the actual change process when you add a new resistor? Because you'd need advanced mathematics including calculus and imaginary numbers to deal with it. In addition to being not all that important or even noticable. Also, as I've stated these changes happen way to fast for a human eye to see. However, if we stuck an actual capacitor in the circuit, a one that can hold a lot more charge than a resistor can, you could actually see these changes happening on a human timescale."]}

{"prompt": "Why Do Wind Turbines Always Have 3 Blades?\nAn elaboration of the question: Wouldn't having more than 3 blades mean that you can catch more wind?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["I just learned this in class last week. The number of blades chosen is a function of the tip speed ratio, which is the velocity of the tip of the blade over the velocity of the wind. If you have a high tip speed ratio, you have a low number of blades. Tip speed ratio is actually chosen for design purposes to be usually about 5 to 7 (i didn't copy the graph down in lecture), and the chart says to use 3 for that range. Basically I guess it's because it's cheapest to produce and transport blades of that length versus how much power you'll get out of the turbine", "Adding more propellors increases weight and turbulence, and can actually make a wind turbine less efficient. Also, the object isn't to catch the most wind, it is to keep the turbine spinning within it optimal range. For a given amount of propellor length, fewer blades are usually better. One blade is obviously impractical because the propeller would be unbalanced. The jump from two to three doesn't lose a lot of efficiency, but it does save a lot of space, allow more shorter towers. More than three doesn't give you as good of a tradoff.", "Three blades is calculated to be the right number to catch the wind but also not too many such that they run into the turbulence of the last blade that passed through that space. Too many blades and they block air rather than catch it."]}
{"prompt": "Why do tires “go off” or get slower over the course of the race?\nAn elaboration of the question: Why do race tires degrade over the course of the race? I get that rubber is removed by friction of the track but shouldn’t the same rubber be exposed?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["New tires have smooth, consistent contact patches. As the race goes on, the tire is subject to extreme asymmetrical loads. This changes the contact patch shape and wears different areas of the tire more quickly. The tire also sees abrasion from the track surface or debris, and if the rubber exceeds ideal temperature the tire can bluster, which causes vibration and additional wear. Therefore, all of these causes lead to a significantly altered contact patch and increased wear. This hurts lap times.", "Race tires are made of somewhat uncured rubber and are VERY soft and sticky rubber, great for the best possible grip while racing. But that also means they have an extremely short life. The both wear out very quickly because they are such soft rubber against an abrasive surface and once they fully heat up the rubber itself starts to cure. One heat cycle and they are no longer fully soft, they have begun to cure to a harder rubber with far less traction."]}
{"prompt": "Why is there one standard for music and movie playback that multiple manufacturers use but not for video games.\nAn elaboration of the question: Example: Sony, Samsung, LG etc, all make VHS, DVD, BluRay players etc, that all play one standard of media, but Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo all have proprietary gaming consoles. Why hasn't gaming gone the way of other media consumption?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Actually they do. Both PS4 games and Xbox One games use Blu-Ray discs. The reason why you can't play a game for one console on the other however is twofold. First, the encoding done on the disks at the time they're burned which includes code that prevents \"unapproved\" disks from being used. This is why you can't just download a ripped version of a next-gen game and burn it to a blu-ray, then stick it in your console. Second, each console has a very strict list of hardware that is used to create the console. This line has gotten blurrier in recent years as consoles have gotten closer and closer to being basically just PCs with specifically tailored operating systems but the hardware limitations still exist. If you were to put a disc from one system into the other and it *were* capable of reading it, the code on the disc still wouldn't necessarily be compatible with the hardware in use by the system. To use a highly generalized example the code on the disc may be expecting a specific graphics processor that isn't used on a competing console. tl;dr - Code on the disk is tailored to the console it's used for, both for antipiracy measures and in order to get as much power as possible from the machine. The fact that this forces consumers to use a specific console for specific games is just a bonus as far as the console manufacturers are concerned."]}

The holes are there to offer room for the material to flex, avoiding the uncomfortable hardness you'd experience if the tires were solid- it fulfills the same purpose as the pressurized air inside a regular tire, as well as lowering weight.

{"prompt": "Why do guns that fire the same caliber of bullet have different muzzle velocities?\nAn elaboration of the question: I'm looking at the wikipedia for the M16 and the M4 carbine. They are both listed as firing 5.56 x 45mm cartridges. The muzzle velocity for the M16 is listed at 960 m/s. The muzzle velocity of the M4 is listed at 910 m/s. Is this a function of barrel length? Some other variable? My understanding was that the same cartridge would have the same amount of gunpowder, leading to the same amount of force propelling the bullet forward.\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Bullets are accelerated by the expanding hot gasses behind the bullet. If your barrel is 3 inches long, the bullet leaves the barrel before all the gas is finished pushing on the bullet. If your barrel is 5 feet long, the gas pushes all it can and then the bullet slows down due to friction in the barrel. Somewhere in the middle is the perfect point where the expanding gas gives the bullet all the energy it can with the least energy lost to friction. The M16 has a longer barrel, giving the bullet more speed when it exits the barrel. The M4 is shorter and more maneuverable in tight spaces, but a little bit of power is lost when you shorten the barrel."]}

Is that true?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Leaving a faucet on a slow drip keeps pipes from bursting when they freeze, not to keep pipes from freezing. If you put a can of soda in the freezer, when the soda freezes, the can might burst because water expands when it freezes solid. If you open the can beforehand, there’s more room for the soda to expand out the opening, the rest of the can will stay intact. Opening a faucet, even a little, makes more room for the water inside your pipes.

A live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors is happy and survives. 3. A live cell with more than 3 live neighbors dies of overcrowding 4.

{"prompt": "SOAP versus REST for web development\nAn elaboration of the question: I've read that SOAP is like putting your letter(request) in an envelope to make it more secure, while REST is just sending is the letter(request) as is.

But what goes on in a SOAP api?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["> I've read that SOAP is like putting your letter(request) in an envelope to make it more secure, while REST is just sending is the letter(request) as is. This is complete nonsense. The difference has absolutely nothing to do with security. Neither SOAP nor REST have encryption as part of the protocol. Someone apparently heard that SOAP has something called an \"envelope\" and completely misunderstood what that means. SOAP has a very detailed (and complex) specification on the message format level, and it is completely based on XML. It doesn't actually need to use HTTP, anything that can deliver text messages and responses works. The important difference is that with SOAP, the messages themselves contain all the information. When used over HTTP, a SOAP web service will have a single URL, and you use it by making a POST request to that URL and sending an XML which says something like \"this is a GetOrderList request and here are its parameters\", and in response you will receive an XML with says \"this as a GetOrderList response, and here is the data\". The advantage is that you have these exact specifications that tell you how requests and responses look like, and they will always follow the same basic rules in every system that uses SOAP. The disadvantage is that the specification (and the XML itself) result in quite a lot of overhead and complexity even if you want to send very simple messages. It is *not* enjoyable to use. In contrast, REST does not really have a standard, it just tries to use the elements of the HTTP standard (URLs, different HTTP methods, some of them previously almost forgotten) directly as part of the \"web service\" concept, the way you described it. This means that it is not really possible to use REST via anything but HTTP. The *format* of REST messages is actually not specified at all, it is typically JSON, but can be XML or even something else. The advantage is that it's simpler and much more pleasant to program, but since there is no real standard, every REST API works a little different, there can be surprises hidden, and in fact many APIs that call themselves REST actually don't follow the basic REST concepts at all - anything where one URL is used for different kinds of requests based on the *content* of the message is not \"RESTful\"."]}

{"prompt": "How come a mechanical watch changes it’s time over a long period of time\nAn elaboration of the question: Found an old watch from a few years ago and it’s around 20 minutes behind what my current time is.\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["For starters, if it's been running nonstop since \"a few years ago\", I doubt it's actually a mechanical watch. A mechanical watch, one driven by a wound up spring and gears, can only run for a few days without needing to be wound. It's far more likely that you have some sort of quartz watch - where a battery run electricity through a crystal and count the vibrations - that simply has an analog face (ie - moving hands instead of an LCD display). Quartz watches can run for years on a single battery without a problem - smart ones can even stop moving the hands to save power & just slide them back to where they belong once motion is detected. That out of the way... Watches and clocks all do one simple thing internally: they make something happen periodically and count how many times it happens. A grandfather clock tracks swings of a pendulum, a mechanical watch tracks the oscillations of a spring loaded weight & quartz movements run electricity through a quartz crystal, causing it to vibrate and they count those vibrations. If the speed of that periodic thing isn't precisely tuned, the timepiece might run slightly fast or slow. Being off by only 20 minutes in a year means that it's 99.996% accurate - if it's been multiple years, that's even more accurate. One source I found online says that typical mechanical watches are typically only accurate to within 10 seconds per day & quartz watches are generally within about 15s per month. If you want to spend more money, you can get more accuracy - as little as 5s per year - but even a $100-150 watch can do 15s/year (as long as you prioritize accuracy over flashiness). All of that pales in comparison to sensitive scientific instruments. Atomic clocks can *easily* be accurate to within a second every million years. The current record is [accurate to 1 second every 15 billion years]( URL_0 ).", "It's essentially impossible to create a mechanical watch that counts time completely accurately, especially given that the internal mechanism changes its timekeeping based on the temperature and other environmental factors. The best mechanical watches typically keep time to within a second per day, which is only an error of about 0.001%, but can easily build up to being off by many minutes if you let them run for long enough."]}

The blue valves open and let in fuel, then close. The piston goes up which compresses the fuel until a spark ignites it. This creates an explosion which pushes the piston back down.

All of the pistons are connected by a shaft in the middle, but are staggered so one or more pistons going down helps push the other pistons up, repeating the process.

I'm not covering direct injection here. 2) compression, the piston moves up and compresses the air and fuel mixture. 3) detonate and expansion, a spark is generated which lights the fuel and air mixture. The heat generated expands the gases in the chamber creating power by pushing the piston down. 4) exhaust, the piston returns up pressing exhaust gases out the exhaust port and then starts back at the intake. Up and down motion is converted to rotary motion via the crankshaft. Valves for intake and exhaust are controlled by camshafts to ensure consistent timing of the opening and closing."]}
{"prompt": "Why do some engines have a much lower redline?\nAn elaboration of the question: What determines how high an engine can rev?

The more mass that has to be moved further gives a lower red line. I have a 8.3L V10 in my car. The redline is at 6k. The pistons are large and they move quite a long distance. By the time you make it to 6k it sounds like the gates of hell have opened up. Smaller engines like my motorcycle can rev up to 17k or more. They are smaller with little stroke movement. The valve train moves very little also. With that combination it can move much faster without parts breaking. Mass in motion. The more mass the less motion. Parts can only withstand a certain amount of stress before breaking.", "It's important to understand, the goal of burning fuel is to produce hot expansive gasses; the consequential pressure pushes on a piston as it tries to find equilibrium. This action is called force, and when it's transformed from linear motion to rotational motion, it's thus called torque - torque is force about an axis. Gasoline engines have a fixed charge of fuel and air that enters a cylinder and is burned, whereas a modern diesel has an initial mix of fuel and air entered into the cylinder, which is ignited by the heat of compression, and then subsequent injections of fuel are introduced during combustion. As a consequence, gasoline engines only produce torque for a fraction of the power stroke, and diesel engines produce torque for the entire power stroke. No diesel engine will run higher than ~5k rpm because diesel fuel *doesn't burn fast enough*. If you ran the engine faster, which is certainly possible, you'll be dumping still burning, still hot and expanding gasses out the exhaust manifold. I'd be a flame throwing explosion past the valve and down the manifold. Diesel engines, then are designed around the advantages of energy density and stability of the fuel and the speed at which it burns. Gasoline burns very fast and is very volatile. Gasoline used to be a waste product before the invention of the internal combustion engine because it was too evaporative and explody. F1 race cars engines are are speed limited by rules, because it was, like, 2008 Ferrari had a 22k rpm engine and they were working on a 25k one. None of the competition had the money or resources to compete, hence the 18-some-k rpm limit. That's how fast gasoline burns. And F1 cars run off (highly refined, if not pure octane) gasoline. Here, the limiting factor is not the fuel, but the mass of the engine components. I think they're running 1.6 L v6 engines, normally aspirated (vacuum pressure sucks charge into the cylinder when the piston strokes down on the intake stroke), and they're still making +700 hp, which is a measure of work. What is work? Think of it this way, if you want to move across a room in half the time, you need to perform twice the work, you don't need twice the force. How do they do that, when my sports car 3.5 L v6 makes 300 hp? If you want to make 700 hp, you need to breathe 700 hp worth of air. These engines are over-square, which means the pistons are wider than the length of their stroke. They move up and down less than an inch. The pistons and rods are made of aluminum, or titanium, or I've heard of connecting rods now made with some sort of carbon fiber type material. All in the name of reducing weight. My sports car engine's pistons at 7.5k rpm are moving the same top speed at the half way point down the cylinder as an F1 engine, but mine has several inches to speed up and slow down, and the rate it has to stop and change directions is much lower. The F1 engine has to stop and change directions more often in the same period of time, at 18k rpm, and less than an inch to do it. The connecting rod actually stretches and compresses, I think up to 1/2\" in some cases. If their components were made from the same shit as my sports car, the engine would explode from the weight alone. Can gasoline burn faster? Yes, but at this point it's a materials problem. Understand that high speed engines are a means to an end. F1 started building fast engines only because the league banned turbochargers in the 80s. If they had that option, these engines would run much slower, because there are more efficient ways of making power. Also be aware that these engines are at the fringes of what's physically possible. F1 regulation requires an engine to last 2 races. They had to impose that because the top teams were pushing their engines so hard they only lasted one race, and smaller teams couldn't compete. This is why street cars don't run stupid fast engines, because the fuel required to do so is expensive as hell, and the maintenance requirements are unsustainable."]}

The right way to check a light is every light needs to be wired individually, then power tested (it needs to use a well known amount of power), this requires electronically switching the light onto the power testing circuit. The circuit doing this needs to be able to actually power the light for test, so it can't be just the 1 cent circuits, it's going to be a rather substantial circuit, and it needs to interface with all the switches.

Sometimes when working with systems you *do* use that kind of calculation, in a black-boxish kind of way, usually to figure out what a source or load 'looks like' to the other parts of the system. Like: if a transistor output is leading into a current-hungry circuit, the intrinsic resistance in the transistor will cause the output voltage to drop (as Ohm's law says it will)... so you might add an emitter follower (aka common collector amplifier) stage that has a large input impedance (high 'resistance') that won't load down the previous circuit and a small output impedance (low 'resistance') that can drive the 'hungry' circuit without sagging... it's basically the opposite of a resistor.

{"prompt": "How does a cars heat and cooling system work\nAn elaboration of the question: Where is the heat & cold air generated from\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Heat is generated by the combustion engine transferred into the coolant through a heat exchanger (radiator) then pumped to another heat exchanger ( heater core) where it is transferred to the cabin air by a blower motor", "Heat is generated from the engine. The engine is using gasoline or diesel and making fire. It has alot of heat. It uses a water system to keep it cool. Some of the heated water is piped into a heat exchanger and fans blow out hot air. Most of the heat goes out on the cars exterior radiator. Cold air is made by an air conditioner. Compressed refrigerant is cold and absorbs heat, and evaporates into a gas, pumped outside, then compressed back into a liquid."]}
{"prompt": "How does a nuclear bomb explode before hitting the ground ?\nAn elaboration of the question: I always thought that a bomb was meant to explode when hitting the ground\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Bombs are made for different purposes, those which explode on impact are designed to destroy what they actually hit, whilst those that explode in the air cause damage to a wider area. Nuclear bombs are an area effect weapon so they work best when detonated at altitude this can be triggered in a number of different ways one of which is using the difference in pressure at different heights.", "While some bombs are crude enough to rely on simple kinetic energy (slamming into the ground) to ignite, many — including nuclear bombs — are not set up that way and require a fuze. A fuze is just a little device that triggers the detonation. For a ground burst, a fuze might be a little button that gets pushed, which would set off a tiny explosion, that would set off the larger, main explosion. For an airburst, there are different kinds of fuzes that can be used either individually or together to make sure the bomb goes off at the right height. All of this applies to conventional as well as nuclear weapons, though with nuclear weapons it is especially important to have good fuzing because they will not typically explode in a nuclear fashion if they just slam into the ground without a fuze (they are complicated devices that require precise timing to work) Examples of aerial fuzing might include: * A timer that activates when the bomb leaves the plane or whatever. This is a very crude method but if you know it will take 45 seconds to fall to the right height, you can just time it. * A device that uses barometric pressure to detect how far up or down it is. The precision on this kind of thing can be tricky, but they have been used. * A device that serves essentially as a little radar antenna to detect where the ground is, by bouncing radio signals off of it. And so on. In the first atomic bombs, all three of these were used in a sequence to make sure that the bombs were more or less at the right altitude before they exploded (the timer made such the bomb was outside of the plane, the barometric switch made sure it was below a certain altitude, and the radar antenna did the final check). You could even use GPS for this sort of thing, though there are errors that might be added. Depending on the nature of the target you are trying to hit, there are pros and cons for setting the bomb off in the air or on the ground. Generally speaking if you are trying to hit something relatively small and \"hard\" — like, say, an underground bunker or silo, or a single building, even a large one, like the Pentagon — you want your bomb to go off as close to the target as possible, because it concentrates the most pressure on it. If you are trying to hit something relatively large and \"soft\" — like, say, a city — you want your bomb to go off in the air, because it disperses medium and light pressures over a larger area (for a variety of reasons). It is just a small note that for many years the nuclear weapons of the USA could _only_ be used as airbursts because it is actually much harder to make a heavy, complex, delicate instrument that goes off at exactly the moment it hits the ground (and before the collision breaks it) than it is to make one that detonates several hundred feed above the ground.", "i believe he is asking \"how\" in terms of how the process flows so the device always explodes before hitting the ground rather than \"why\" we let them explode above ground", "Blowing up a bomb in the air has a different effect than one hitting the ground, or even below the ground. An explosion in the air covers a much wider area instead of directing energy down into the ground. Of course, if your target is a subterranean bunker, then they have ground penetrating bombs to take are of that.", "They have their own trigger mechanisms so impact with the ground doesn't have to be the trigger. They explode before they hit the ground because people either remote detonate them or set a timer that makes sure they go off that way (*why* air detonations are used has been explained by other users a bit). Separately, for a nuke to work a *very* precise series of firing mechanisms has to take place. The explosion has to start in a very specific, controlled way. If you just hit a nuclear bomb with another non-nuclear bomb to blow it up, it wouldn't go nuclear. It's not as simple as \"hit something and the reaction goes nuclear.\""]}
{"prompt": "What is a monolithic structure in operating systems?\nAn elaboration of the question: Follow up question, what kind of structure do the most popular OS use? Windows - ? MacOS - ? Linux - ? Android - ? iOS - ?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["In software, a monolith is a single program which performs a large number of tasks, but is still a single binary. The alternative to a monolith is to break the large program up into several smaller programs, each of which has a more narrow list of responsibilities. The alternative to a monolith is called (especially if you like buzzwords) something like \"Service Oriented Architecture\" or \"Microservices\". Monolith: One big program which performs a number of tasks Microservices: Many little programs, each of which only does one thing Operating systems are just programs, although they have a very specific set of responsibilities and are treated specially by the system. Some of these responsibilities are things like memory management, process management, thread management, disk management, device drivers, event handling and routing, I/O processing, interrupt processing, security and access, etc. Despite the fact that something like \"Process management\" is a pretty different beast from \"I/O processing\", these two things are still compiled into a single Kernel binary. In a monolith, if you need to update one of these, you have to update the whole shebang. This is a monolith. The alternative to a monolith would be to break all the different responsibilities into their own binaries, and those would communicate over some kind of messaging channel. This is called a \"Microkernel\" approach. Microkernel seems nice because each individual service can be smaller, simpler, and able to be managed/updated independently. The problem comes because the messaging channel which allows these services to communicate starts to become very complicated: handling enough bandwidth, keeping messages properly ordered, serializing and deserializing, keeping message contract versions in sync between services, etc. And then there are all the complexities where you have to keep track of which order the services are initialized in during boot-up, and all the million possible scenarios of what the system should do if one of the services crashes while the other ones are still healthy, etc. Linux, BSD and Android are pure monoliths. Windows basically uses \"hybrid\" approach with three basic parts: HAL, \"the microkernel\" and \"the executive\", where \"the microkernel\" is basically a normal monolithic kernel, and \"the executive\" contains several services which operate in kernel mode. Darwin (iOS, OSX) also uses a hybrid approach, though it's harder to describe. There's a kernel called \"Mach\", but there are components borrowed from FreeBSD like I/O and POSIX, and there are also a number of microkernel-like services though many of them run in user-space to avoid context-switches. The only \"real\" microkernel system I can think of for modern OS's is GNU Hurd, which has been under development for nearly 30 years and STILL isn't ready for reliable wide-spread use because of the inherent complexities of the approach. Symbian was a microkernel, but a lot of complexity there disappeared because symbian ran on single-core phones, and Symbian isn't really a thing anymore with the advent of iOS and Android.", "A monolithic structure means the kernel (all OS's have them) are set up so that the kernel does everything. This was the way it was first done in Linux - back when you had to compile your own kernel if you wanted support for sound (for example). As kernels got more sophisticated, they became too large to go with the \"one size fits all\" things, so they evolved to use modules, that could be added in whenever needed, and to accomodate more complex and sophisticated hardware. Nowadays, I don't know what Windows uses, but as for MacOS, I'm pretty sure they use a monolithic kernel, since the hardware is pretty narrowly defined. Linux used modules, but I'm not sure about Android or iOS. Soneone else could give a better better idea about these things. Hope this helps."]}

If you put some hooks on it then when you drag it the hooks will dig in and fight your motion more than just the weight of the anchor", "This is more complicated than one would think, actually. & nbsp; First off, understand that anchors are not actually what keeps the boat from moving. It's actually the cable that connects the anchor to the boat which keeps the boat or other sea vessel stationary. The cable uses the movement of the water to form a natural catenary. The catenary is the curve of a cable. This occurs because the cable is fixed to the boat and the ground so the weight of the cable causes the catenary. This curve of the cable absorbs the sudden movements of the water, such as waves, and allows the vessel to remain in place. & nbsp; Now, the catenary only works properly if it is safely secured at both ends. This is where the anchor comes into play. There are various types of anchors that are used. It all depends on the material that makes up the sea bottom. Some areas are extremely rocky and require a different anchor than if it were a soft sand. Their shapes are all different. For example, the [Mushroom Anchor]( URL_0 :) is used in a soft sea bottom for vessels that are going to be there awhile. It is designed so that it goes straight into the sea bottom and uses suction to remain. This is for more permanent mooring. The more traditional [Fisherman's Anchor]( URL_1 :) is designed so that the two flukes (points) can dig into a soft sand bottom."]}

None of this is good.", "Guns are made up of a bunch of metal pieces that need to slide around each other fairly closely. If pieces heat up at different rates, they'll expand differently and may have trouble sliding around in the right way. Inside a bullet is a tiny explosion that gets directed down a tube. This tends to heat up the bits involved in bits that handle those hot gasses.

Many (not all) fully automatic firearms work using a direct impingement or similar gas-powered mechanism for pushing the bolt back, ejecting a the spent case, and loading a new round. Generally, this is the mechanism that fails in an automatic rifle. Basically how it works is there is a \"block\" near the end of the barrel that directs some of the gasses created by the ignited gunpowder up and into a tube that directs it back to cycle the bolt. Normally either the block will get so hot it \"melts\" or deforms and stops directing the gas the right way. Or the gas tube can do the same thing. Now, there's another mechanism. Good old fashioned blowback. It uses the gasses created by the gunpowder as well- but instead of traveling down a tube from the end of the barrel, it's designed so the bolt is quite literally blown back by the expanding gas in the actual chamber. So for this design, everyone else has already explained it. Usually a barrel can \"droop\" from getting so hot the metal is malleable, or other miscellaneous parts can be malformed or break from getting hot. As for how it's done in a video game- well, it's a video game. To be honest they're never very accurate about firearms. But if it were always 100 percent accurate it wouldn't be fun right?"]}

The Sydney Coordinated Adaptive Traffic System, abbreviated SCATS, is an intelligent transportation system that manages the dynamic (on-line, real-time) timing of signal phases at traffic signals, meaning that it tries to find the best phasing (i.e. cycle times, phase splits and offsets) for a traffic situation (for individual intersections as well as for the whole network). SCATS is based on the automatic plan selection from a library in response to the data derived from loop detectors or other road traffic sensors. SCATS uses sensors at each traffic signal to detect vehicle presence in each lane and pedestrians waiting to cross at the local site. The vehicle sensors are generally inductiveloops installed within the road pavement. The pedestrian sensors are usually push buttons. Various other types of sensors can be used for vehicle presence detection, provided that a similar and consistent output is achieved. Information collected from the vehicle sensors allows SCATS to calculate and adapt the timing of traffic signals in the network. SCATS is installed at about 42,000 intersections in over 154 cities in 25 countries. In Australia, where the system was first developed, the majority of signalised intersections are SCATS operated (around 11,000)."]}

{"prompt": "How does military camouflage work?\nAn elaboration of the question: How does it allow for snipers to be invisible. Or how does it allow hunters to be invisible while hunting deer?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Camouflage patterns don't actually make you invisible, it just makes it harder for someone to spot you. My 7th grade bio teacher had a great demonstration to explain camouflage in nature, you can try it yourself if you have different colored construction paper. Everyone gathered around their black table/desk top. Scattered around the surface were tiny squares of paper cut up, all a variety of colors. Red, blue, black, white, yellow, purple, etc. All the students were told to pick up as many of the squares as they could in 30 seconds, but you could only pick up one square at a time and then put it into a cup. By the end of the thirty seconds, there were almost as many black squares as there were when we started, a lot of dark purple squares, and almost no white or yellow squares, because the darker colors matched the black table top. That's how camouflage works (and how natural selection gives lots of animals natural camouflage). The reason for this is that eyes are very good at spotting changes, things that are different from the world around it, but are more likely to skim over things that are blending in with their background, like black paper on a black table or camouflaged snipers in the bushes. Military camouflage has similar colors to the leaves/dirt of the territory the wearer is working in, and it's arranged in round-ish blotches because it more closely matches the patterns of the leaves around the wearer. Because the clothes (and sometimes face paint) blends in with the area, it's much easier for someone looking in the direction of a sniper or hunter to miss them entirely, their eyes passing over the clothes without seeing a change from the environment. tl;dr: Eyes are good at noticing change, and when camouflage matches the area around it, it blends in, so eyes are more likely to skim over it and not notice.", "Mostly it works to disturb the human outline. We're very good at spotting humans and human-ish shapes. Have you ever seen a person in the dark but there wasn't actually anything there?

{"prompt": "why is it bad for planes to have a full tank of fuel?\nAn elaboration of the question: My pilot tonight held us up by an hour on the tarmac waiting for the fuel crew to pump out excess fuel. The fuel crew never showed up so the pilot announced we’re going to fly at a lower altitude to burn 1,700 lbs of fuel. Why would the pilot do that? Isn’t it a waste and harmful to the environment?\nHere is my answer: ", "response": ["Aircraft have different maximum take-off weight and maximum landing weight. The forces on a aircraft is higher when you land compared to when you take off. It is quite obvious when you are take a flight. A takeoff are smooth but there is/can be a significant bump when you hit the ground and land. For a Airbus A 380 the maximum take-off weight is 575t and the maximum landing weight is 394t or 68% of the take off weight. and it can load 323,545 L ~300 t of fuel so a significant part of the withe of the plane when fully loaded is fuel In normal operation this is not a problem because the plane used fuel during its flight and you have the minimum amount of fule that you need to travel to the destination + a bit extra for diversions or other emergency. The result is that the plane when landing on a normal flight is as light as possible. You what to minimize weight because that will reduce fule usage. So if a aircraft have to do a unscheduled landing for a emergency it might need to dump fuel into the air so it can land in a safe way. I would guess that the aircraft you was incorrectly fule a mistake or fueled for a different destination that changed. So the alternative was to pump it out or fly in a less fuel efficient way so the weight of the plane is below the maximum landing weight when you land at the destination", "Was it a short flight? Maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) is higher than maximum landing weight (MLW). On a long flight, the plane will always burn enough fuel to be below MLW, even if it starts with a maximum fuel load. On a short flight, that isn’t always true. Say you have a plane going from NYC to London. It’s fuelled to near capacity. Some issue arises shortly after takeoff that means that the plane cannot continue across the Atlantic Ocean. If the issue is urgent enough, you can land right away, above MLW. But the plane will have to be thoroughly inspected as it may be damaged. If you can stay in the air and dump fuel or just circle to burn it (some planes don’t have dump valves) till the plane crosses under the MLW threshold, that is preferable. What I am speculating happened with your flight is that it was a short one and was overfuelled. With a normal course, the plane would arrive at its destination over the MLW and that is no good. Dumping fuel is an emergency measure, worse for the environment than burning it, and not possible on all planes. So instead the pilot purposefully flies a less efficient (lower) route so that more fuel is burned in flight and by the time it arrives at the destination airport, it is light enough to land without risking structural damage. You probably also made better time than scheduled. Cruise speed is a balance of fuel burnt and time spent. If you have to waste fuel, you might as well use it to go as fast as possible.", "Fuel is heavy. Commercial planes can have higher maximum take-of weights than their maximum landing weights. Your plane can weigh a lot more when it starts then when it lands. This usually makes sense because you burn fuel and it gets lighter during the flight. However when you need to land before you thought you would or started with more fuel than needed for some reason you have a problem. Normally it makes sense to fly with as little fuel as needed because fuel is expensive and even just carry around fuel that you don't use ends up wasting fuel to transport the extra mass. In an emergency situation there is also the added consideration that you don't want to crash with giant tin can fuel of highly flammable fuel."]}
